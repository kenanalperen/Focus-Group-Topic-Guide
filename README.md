# <h1>Focus Group Topic Guide</h1>

This document outlines the structure of our focus groups, the topics discussed, the main questions asked, and the information provided to participants during the sessions. This ensures the repeatability of our research.

## <h2>Overview</h2>
We conducted three focus group sessions with participants representing different types of robot operators:  
- **Telemanipulator Operators**  
- **UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) Operators**  
- **ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle) Operators**  

Each session focused exclusively on topics relevant to the respective operator type. The discussions were divided into two parts:  
1. **<b>Human-Robot Interaction</b>** – Examining operator roles, interface needs, and preferences within the control room.  
2. **<b>Remote Environment</b>** – Addressing tasks and environmental challenges.  

For each topic, a representative figure was provided alongside presentation slides.
